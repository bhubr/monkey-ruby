# Monkey / Ruby

This is an attempt to port the "Monkey" language interpreter described in [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) to Ruby.

I didn't bother to comment the code, and if you're interested in knowing more, I can only recommend that you **buy and read the book**.

It's well-written, and even if you don't know Go, pretty accessible. Having laid my hands on a few compiler books and tutorials, I can only say it's the best introductory material I've come across, by far.
